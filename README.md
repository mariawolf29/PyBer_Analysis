# PyBer_Analysis
## In this ride-sharing analyze two technical analyses were performed:

### Technical Analysis 1- a summary DataFrame of the key metrics for the ride-sharing data  by city type was performed.
The technical deliverables 1 were analyzed in:
#### DataFrame where for each city type I calculated: 
    Total Rides, 
    Total Drivers, 
    Total Fares, 
    Average Fare per Ride,
    Average Fare per Driver
    
This DataFrame shows us that the most rides with the most drivers we can find in the Urban city typer, the least in the Rural, but the highest average fare per ride and per drivers are in the Rural city types. Urban city types has 13 times more rides than Rural and 2.6 times more that in Suburban. Which translate to the highest Total Fares for Urban city types.

### Technical Analysis 2 â€“ the technical deliverables 2 were analyzed: 
#### in the Pivot table where:
total fares per week for each city type were calculated. Based on this Pivot table multiple-line graph was produced.
#### in multible-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by each city type
